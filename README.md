# TreasureGame (aka Flamboyant)
3D Game Space Shooter made in 4 days for a UPC FIB Course (Advanced Course in Video Game Development with Unity 3D).

It was very interesting to see how we not only saw how to use the Unity engine, but also how to program taking into account a SOLID methodology and use it in the development of videogames. It was very enriching, I always wanted to make a kind of space shooter reminiscent of Ikaruga, a great game by Treasure.

Also, got a perfect mark! =)
